# FuelFlow

App built as a joke because of my friend who doesn't finish his beers and claims he drinks more than he does. Users of the mobile app join parties which are identified by a given 4 digit alphanumeric code, and others can join. While inside the party, you can add a drink to your counter, but only after it is confirmed by everyone else in the group.

This app was only hacked together with a few hours work and should not be used in any practical sense.

Frontend can be run with `flutter run` and the backend can be run with `npm start` after running `npm install`
